- Discussion 2: The simple Pi program and why it sucks
- Module 4: Synchronization (Pi program revisited)
- Discussion 3: Synchronization overhead and eliminating false sharing
- Module 5: Parallel Loops (making the Pi program simple)
- Discussion 4: Pi program wrap-up

### Unit 3: Working with OpenMP
- Module 6: Synchronize single masters and stuff

- Discussion 5: Debugging OpenMP programs
- Module 8: Skills practice … linked lists and OpenMP
- Discussion 6: Different ways to traverse linked lists

### Unit 4: a few advanced OpenMP topics
- Module 9: Tasks (linked lists the easy way)
- Discussion 7: Understanding Tasks
- Module 10: The scary stuff … Memory model, atomics, and flush (pairwise synch).
- Discussion 8: The pitfalls of pairwise synchronization
